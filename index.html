<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>
LI Web is a group of talented developers, designers, administrators, marketers, managers and leaders who work in the web space.
</p>
<p>
We hold several different types of events including Presentation Nights, Dev Sprints and Social Outings. Our goal is to share knowledge, ideas and help build a community of like minded professionals on Long Island.
</p>
<p>
Our meetups are typically held at Stony Brook University and the surrounding area. We want to connect technology professionals with our students and the wider the University Community.
</p>
<p>
We also understand the challenges involved with community building and want to encourage anyone interested in hosting their own tech nights to let us know and we'll be happy to cross promote or make you an event organizer.
</p>
We look forward to building and growing this community and the exciting learning opportunities that are ahead of us!
